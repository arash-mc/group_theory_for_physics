# Chapter 1: Elements of Group theory

## 1-1 Correspondence and transformation

In this section the general idea of correspondence and transformation and how the transformations are associative but not commutative and the inverse of transformation being in reverse order and the idea of the identity transformation are introduced.
example1 and **chapter1_pboblem1** are introduced.

## 1-2 Groups. Definitions and examples 

Group G:

1. Contains the identity element $I$.
2. For each transformation $M$ we have the inverse $M^{-1}$.
3. If it includes $M$ and $M'$, it also includes $MM'$.

The Euclidean (rigid body) motion form a group. The set of permutaions of n numbers make a group, etc.
